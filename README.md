# UniFi portal

A very simple (Dutch) guest portal setup for Ubiquity UniFi.

In the _Guest Control_ section of the Unifi Controller setting, select the _Legacy JSP_ template engine and place these files in `/Applications/UniFi.app/Contents/Resources/data/sites/default/portal`. Check the option _Override templates with custom changes_, just to be sure.


The Guest portal is available at `http://<hostname>:8880/guest/s/default/`.
